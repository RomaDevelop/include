.h-lib can be used* just with #include "lib_name.h"
in that case, if .h-lib not added into the make (or other) file
the compiler may not see the changes in the library, 
because the project file to which the library was added has not been changed.

* libs with QObject children will not work just with #include, they must be added into the project
